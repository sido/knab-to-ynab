knab-to-ynab
============

Convert [Knab](https://www.knab.nl) transactions export to [YNAB (You Need A Budget)](http://www.youneedabudget.com) import file.

### Install

First make sure [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is installed and install used dependencies by running `npm install` in a terminal.
Please note I've only tried it on Mac OS X, but Linux should also work fine.

### Usage

Download the Knab export to this directory and run `./knab-to-ynab` in a terminal and a file named 'ynab.csv' will be created which you can import into YNAB.
